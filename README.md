# Welcome to my Portfolio's github page!

## The goal of this project

Create an intelligent display of my github projects that would update automatically alongside my public repositories on github.com
Get experience working with a CMS other than wordpress and contentful
Use Netlify's full service deployment platform to gain experience away from Heroku.

# Next Steps:

- Switch out to getting a user's repo data from Github's v4 API.
- Use Netlify CMS to build out a blog platform that displays alongside the list of repos.
