Web Engineering; that’s exactly what I’ve been training for in General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive. This career change has been a huge leap for me, moving my whole family from central Pennsylvania down to join the Atlanta tech community.

My past experience blends really well with what Gather is looking for in a web developer. I worked as a Chief Lighting Technician for a traveling concert tour. Often times I had to fix extremely complicated moving lights with no prior experience and documentation in different languages. Equipped with the newest version of the user manual I could find a set of precision screwdrivers and I was able to repair tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment while on their very tight schedule.

Building web applications has a lot of parallels with fixing physical machines and equipment. I am very experienced in using incomplete documentation and using logical discovery to make every process as robust and efficient as possible.

I am future-focused and a ravenous learner. I lead from any position by relating to my co-workers and taking full responsibility for my projects.
