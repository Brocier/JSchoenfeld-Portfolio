Web Engineering; that’s exactly what I’ve been training for in General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive. This career change has been a huge leap for me, moving my whole family from central Pennsylvania down to join the Atlanta tech community.

My past experience has lent itself really well to development and the Engineer mindset. At one point I worked as the Chief Lighting Technician for a national concert tour. Often times I had to fix relatively complicated moving lights with no prior technical or electrical experience and documentation in different languages. Equipped with the newest version of the user manual I could find online, and a set of precision screwdrivers I always had on hand I was able to repair tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment while on a very tight schedule.

Building web applications has a lot of parallels with fixing physical machines and equipment. I am very experienced in using incomplete documentation and using logical discovery to make every process as robust and efficient as possible. It wasn't a strange sight for my team to find me hanging 10 ft in the air on a piece of steel truss, adjusting the binary channel signature of a strobe light.

For fun, I play with my 2 dogs, 3 cats, and read fantasy-fiction books.

I am future-focused and a ravenous learner. I lead from any position by relating to my co-workers and taking full responsibility for my projects.
