### Tiberius

My Cat. This 15 lb furball has a healthy pair of lungs and a wonderfully soft coat. Can usually be found in my lap.

### Braille

Wife's Cat. One eye is blind. Very snuggly and loyal. We're pretty sure she can see into other dimensions.

### Arya

My first cat. Found her as a kitten under a porch, and brought her home with the intention of dropping her off at a shelter in the morning. She fell asleep on my chest that night and never left my heart.

### Sawyer

Wife's snuggliest doggo.
He's the family emotional support animal who has more love than any other living creature. Penny's bff.
