### Murdock

My Dog. Husky/GSP mix. 60-70lbs with a lot of fur.

### Tiberius

My Cat. Got him from a foster as a kitten. I wanted an orange long haired cat, and my wife helped me find him.

### Braille

Cat. One eye is blind. Very snuggly and loyal. Our most skittish cat.

### Arya

My first cat. Found her as a kitten under a porch, and brought her home with the intention of dropping her off at a shelter in the morning. She fell asleep on my chest that night and never left my heart.

### Sawyer

The snuggliest doggo.
He's the family emotional support animal who gives and takes more love than any other living creature.
